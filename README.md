# Tembo Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

```
$ yarn
```

### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.


### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Recommended Workflow

* Check out new branch
* npm run start
  * commits locally... looking at site in browser
  * push to remote each commit (opened draft PR)
* Ready to go?
  * Review preview environment
  * Squash and merge without review needed


### Deployment

`main` is auto-deployed to http://new.tembo.io
